*[ ] Change the fields in the wp_options table (siteurl/home) in the database with your domain address extension

*[ ] Log in with admin information via siteurl.com/wp-admin

*[ ] Save the changes by selecting the Post name from Settings/Permalinks/Permalink Structure. This process will update the Htaccess File.

*[ ] The plugin is active. You can check it in wp-content\plugins\cyangate-product-plugin

*[ ] The Cyangate Add Product Page page remains static even though the htaccess has been updated. That's why it was listed again under Product List on the homepage. You Can Access the Product Add Form This Way (/cyangate-add-product-page/)
